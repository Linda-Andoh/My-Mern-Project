Creating a Sticky Note App

This is an Interesting App that allows new users to create new accounts by Signing up. While Old users can Log in and out any time.

 The app loads quickly and enables users to take notes.
 Writing something down on a sticky note gives us the ability to quickly capture a new piece of data or information we've gathered from the universe — whether it's something a user said, an interesting idea we came across, or a simple reminder like “do laundry”.

 I created my app using the Mern Stack and used Css, Html and Javascript. I have a board with a bunch of sticky notes and a user will be able to create new notes, delete and update any note they prefer. 

 Notes will be saved on the users local storage...
